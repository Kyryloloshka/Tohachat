# Tohachat - React + Appwrite + TanStack Query


## In this review, I will show what Tohachat looks like.

But it is important to note the things with which this project was made
### In this project, I had to face big tasks such as:
- Authorization
- Management of api requests
- multiple pages
- active interaction with the database
- work with adaptive sites

### So, in this project, such technologies as
- React + Vite
- Appwrite
- TanStack Query
- TailwindCss
- TypeScript

## I am ready to show all the assets of this project:

### Page for creating a publication

### Profile page where there are both posts published by the user and liked posts

<img alt="picture" src="README_MEDIA_FILES/9.jpg"></img>
### There is a very simple settings page with only one option
<p>
Changing the theme takes place through LocalStorage, that is, while the session is active. And it will be saved even after reloading the page

### Adaptability
<p>
it is important to note that the entire page is fully responsive and available on devices of any screen size
